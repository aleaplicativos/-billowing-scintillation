About The Scintillating Grid Illusion

Black dots appear to form and vanish at the intersections of the gray horizontal and vertical lines. When focusing attention on a single white dot, some gray dots nearby and some black dots a little further away also seem to appear. More black dots seem to appear as the eye is scanned across the grid (as opposed to focusing on a single point). The Scintillating Grid Illusion was discovered  E. Lingelbach in 1994. 

*** 
Curiously, the effect of the scintillation is lessened by cocking the head  45Â°.
